## Our seventh project @WBS coding school
### Recommender Systems

---

Our seventh project for the Coding Boot Camp! This time we cover recommender systems (and showcase them via streamlit).   
I will try to catch up here asap, but more important things going on tbh, since i am already preparring my final project.  
Probably no article about that one, itÂ´s quite simple compared to the ML before and NLP i want to cover in the last one.
